# Advanced Image Generation and Reconstruction with VAE-GAN Models

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Deep Learning project focused on image generation and reconstruction using Fully Connected AutoEncoders, Variational Autoencoders (VAE), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The models were trained and tested using the Fashion-MNIST dataset, offering insights into different generative techniques in computer vision.

## Features
- **AutoEncoder Implementation**: A Fully Connected AutoEncoder model that compresses and reconstructs images, helping understand the basics of neural network based image compression.
- **Generative Modeling**: Utilization of a naive generative model to create new, recognizable hand-written digits from random inputs.
- **Advanced VAE-GAN Model**: Development of a sophisticated VAE-GAN model to improve the quality of generated images significantly.
- **Experimentation with Gaussian Bottlenecks**: Implementation of Gaussian constraints in the bottleneck layers to refine the learning process and output quality.
